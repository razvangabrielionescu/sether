                            When you make changes in Sponge a private workspace is created for your
                            user, separate from the rest of the project. Other users cannot see
                            these changes until they are published, and you cannot see changes that
                            were published by other users after you started making changes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To run a spider or make your changes visible to other users you must
                            first publish ({{icon-button icon='publish'}}) the changes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To clean your private workspace, and get back to the most recently
                            published version of your project, you can discard your changes
                            ({{icon-button icon='rollback'}}).
